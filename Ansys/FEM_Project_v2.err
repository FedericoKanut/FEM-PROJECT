 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.891   TIME= 16:12:32
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      10.109   TIME= 16:12:38
 Pivoting has been activated for the Sparse Matrix Solver .  The memory  
 required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that event, use   
 the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or memory size      
 used by the Sparse Matrix Solver.
