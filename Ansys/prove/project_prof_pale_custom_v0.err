 A large negative pivot value ( -5.264282266E-03 ) has been encountered  
 in the global assembled matrix at the ROTY degree of freedom of node    
 12.  This may be caused by a bad temperature-dependent material         
 property used in the model.

 Both solid model and finite element model boundary conditions have been 
 applied to this model.  As solid loads are transferred to the nodes or  
 elements, they can overwrite directly applied loads.
